## Issues

> :exclamation: **Important**: Only the Faculty of Engineering is currently tested. There may be a lot of places without adaptation!

If you meet any bugs or issues, please contact with developer, or file an issue and describe what operation caused the bugs.Please file any issues, bugs, or feature requests in the [Issues](https://github.com/huhugiter/TUS_CLASS/issues). Thx :kissing_heart:

### Known bugs / issues

- For each subject, the form of the timetable may slightly **different** and needs to be implemented
- Because the website is ‚Äúsingle-threaded" (you can't back or move forward), be sure to wait for the loading to complete (e.g. timetable will only load once and be cached)
